        Sure, Superman may be able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, Spider-Man can stick to any surface imaginable, and Wolverine has those indestructible claws, but there is no cooler gimmick in the comic book industry than Batman's collection of gadgets. Since the character's creation in 1939, the Caped Crusader has introduced the world to some of the sharpest tech innovations in all of pop-culture, and he has even managed to evolve with the technological advancements in the real world over the decades.
        
        It seems like for every situation Batman finds himself in, he has a gadget ready to deal with it. And that is exactly why this character has endured for over 70 years. He wasn't born with super powers, and he wasn't bitten by a radioactive bat; instead he uses his tech resources to help him win his war on crime. He's the working man's hero who just so happens to be a billionaire playboy.
        
        And with the character getting ready to end his current cinematic saga this Friday in The Dark Knight Rises, we decided to take a look back at The 50 Coolest Batman Gadgets.

        50. Finger Taser

        Notable appearance: Detective Comics #871
        
        Batman’s arsenal is filled with countless non-lethal gadgets for his war on crime. And while some of them are large and somewhat gaudy, a recent addition to his armory is so small you would never even know it’s there unless you really piss him off. In Detective Comics #871, Batman unleashed a powerful taser hidden in the index finger of his glove on Becca Mulcahey as she snuck up behind him in an attempt on his life. Small and compact, this weapon is perfect for the Dark Knight when carrying excess weight is not an option.
        
        49. Collapsible Bat-Sword

        Notable appearance: Batman: The Brave and the Bold
        
        It’s not like Batman to carry around a weapon capable of such lethal potential, but the collapsible Bat-Sword from the Batman: The Brave and the Bold cartoon is an exception. Resembling a lightsaber from the Star Wars universe, this sword was used by Batman when battling against an army of robots unleashed by the Clock King. This gadget is yet another ingenious creation exclusive to the Dark Knight’s animated world. It just goes to show that not all of the character’s classic toys had to start out on the comic book page.
        
        48. Electromagnet

        Notable appearance: Batman #584
        
        At all times, Batman carries with him a miniature electromagnet capable of erasing any video tape or audio recording someone might try to make of him while he’s out fighting crime. This has made any footage of Batman nearly impossible to get, thus keeping his actual existence a mystery to the world. This little gadget first appeared in an issue of Batman written by Ed Brubaker that focused on a documentary film crew gathering evidence about whether or not Batman actually exists.
        
        After realizing they actually got a clear shot of him, he took it upon himself to use the electromagnet to erase their footage, while probably killing their careers in the process. As the crew went home to their dingy studio apartments, Batman went home to his spacious mansion and billions of dollars. Justice had been served.

    Notable appearance: Batman & Q!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!````
    \        
        Paul Pope’s gritty, futuristic look at Batman was both brilliant and severely underrated when it hit stands in 2006. In the story, Batman is hunted by an overreaching government in Gotham’s police state, but it’s never made clear who is exactly under the mask. What is clear, though, is that this version of Batman is far more frightening than what we have grown accustomed to over the years.
        
        And one of the tactics he uses to scare criminals is a pair of fake vampire teeth that he created. This makeshift tool makes the scum of the city truly believe that he is an otherworldly creature of the night, and it quickly brings these criminals to their knees before he ever has to throw a punch.
        
        44. Underwater Boot Propellers

        Notable appearance: Batman #611
        
        When Poison Ivy has Superman under her control, she orders him to attack Batman and Catwoman during Jeph Loeb’s best-selling storyline, “Hush.” The Man of Steel’s initial attack sends both Catwoman and the Dark Knight into the water below with very little hope for survival. Fortunately for a quickly-drowning Catwoman, not only can Batman swim, but he has miniature propellers built into his boots that allow him to glide through the water.
        
        Within moments, the Caped Crusader grabs Catwoman by the hand and brings her to safety. Like most of his gadgets, we have never seen these propellers before or since their one appearance, but they’re very cool nonetheless.
        
        43. Computerized Batarang

        Notable appearance: Batman Returns
        
        We’re not denying the Caped Crusader’s accuracy, but even the best of us need some help every once in a while. That’s why in Batman Returns he pulled out a computerized Batarang that automatically targeted nearby enemies and flew around with a mind of its own, seemingly. It worked by traveling on a predetermined path that Batman punched into its miniature console.
        
        This was a convenient way to ensure accuracy and defeat numerous foes with one throw. Unfortunately this gadget has never been seen again in any medium. It seems like even a billionaire has his limits, and this might have been a bit too costly for his bat budget.
        
        42. Magnetic Batarang
        Not Available Interstitial

        Notable appearance: Green Lantern #16
        
        The magnetic version of the classic Batarang is the perfect tool for the Dark Knight to take out robotic threats from throughout the DC Universe. As many of us know through unfortunate household accidents, it’s never a good idea to put a magnet near electronics, and this tool uses that principle as an offensive measure in Batman’s super-powered brawls.
        
        In Green Lantern #16, by writer Geoff Johns, Batman uses this Batarang to scramble the high-tech armor of the Rocket Reds and magnetize their armor together, making them vulnerable to an attack by Black Lightning. Not even a pack of armored Russian war machines stand a chance against an unhinged billionaire with a few cool toys.
